# IMF-Measuring-Digital-Economy-in-the-USA
The IMF publishes a range of time series data on IMF lending, exchange rates and other economic and financial indicators. Manuals, guides, and other material on statistical practices are also available.  Against a backdrop of slow growth of GDP and productivity, concerns that existing macroeconomic statistics may not fully capture the gains from digital and digitally-enabled products and activities have become a topic of much discussion and debate.   The understanding of the implications of digitalization for macroeconomic and financial statistics and developing strategies to fill the measurement gaps is a very important knowledge.
