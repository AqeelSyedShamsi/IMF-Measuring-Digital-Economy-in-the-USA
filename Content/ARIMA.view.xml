    <html:div style="font-size:120%;">The auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) algorithm is famous in econometrics, statistics and
time series analysis. An ARIMA model can be written as ARIMA (p, d, q), where p refers to the auto regressive
order, d refers to integrated order, and q refers to the moving average order. This algorithm helps you
understand the time series data better and predict future data in the series.<html:br></html:br>
The auto regressive integrated moving average with intervention (ARIMAX) algorithm is an extension for
ARIMA. Compared with ARIMA, an ARIMAX model can not only get the internal relationship with former data,
but also take external factor into consideration.<html:br></html:br>

An ARIMA model is a universalization of an auto regressive moving average (ARMA) model. The integrated
part is mainly applied to induce stationary when data show evidence of non-stationary.<html:br></html:br>
An ARIMA (p, d, q) model can be expressed as:<html:br></html:br>
Φ(B)(1−B)d(Yt−c)=Θ(B)εt, t∈Z
